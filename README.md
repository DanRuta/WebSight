In 2011, the world health organization determined that there are 246 million people who have low vision (Pascolini D, M. S., 2011). Navigation and pathfinding are issues they have to deal with every day. Solutions include sonar devices, canes, and carers.

On the web, people with low vision can turn on high contrast mode, to ease the strain and increase the detail perceived.

What if we took that concept and applied it to their lives outside of web surfing?

Sobel sight is a small experiment that sets out to explore and implement a system to help give visually impaired people a new perspective on life.
